# 1. Introduction {#1-introduction}


## Motivation and background *

In todayâ€™s digital era, the need for efficient e-ticketing systems is paramount, as traditional manual ticketing processes often lead to long queues, security vulnerabilities, and ticket misplacement or damage. These challenges not only inconvenience customers but also pose operational hurdles for event organizers and involved institutions. Long queues around  venues not only test the patience of customers but also strain the operational efficiency of event organizers. Moreover, security loopholes leave systems vulnerable to fraud and breaches such as ticket scalping and resale. Additionally, physical tickets are prone to being misplaced, damaged, or even counterfeited, leading to revenue losses for the business and customer dissatisfaction. Addressing these multifaceted issues is crucial for enhancing customer satisfaction, ensuring operational efficiency, and safeguarding the integrity of ticketing systems.


To address these challenges, a proposed e-ticketing system that leverages cutting-edge technology
to streamline the ticketing process, enhance security measures, and eliminate the risk of ticket
loss or damage is implemented. By transitioning to an electronic ticketing system, customers can
conveniently purchase tickets online or through mobile applications, reducing the need for
physical queues and manual processing.
